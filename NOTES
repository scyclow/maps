Theory
  https://jacket2.org/commentary/introduction-maps



AVENUE
  - thicker lines
  - spawn streets at ~90deg
  - occasionally spawn other avenues

STREET
  - occasionally skip
  - occasionally jump over
  - stop at avenues with higher precidence

HIGHWAY
  - sort of like avenues, exept overlaps, no precidence, no spawns (except maybe exits)

POLYGON
  - river
    - stop or bridge



Styles
  - out of focus/seeing doubles
  - very wavy
  - multiple layers with blended starting/stopping

  skeumorphism
    Another interesting theme I tried to explore with Maps of Nothing is the idea of "skeumorphism".
    lots of very good generative art that simulates analogue prints. drew a lot of inspiration from these projects

    but there's a sort of tension between that and leaning into the digitalness of digital media.

    fun to really exagerate the imperfections. And in some cases, it highlights the absurdity of including physical misprint styles in a digital work.

    There are similar misprints to FIM. but unlike with FIM, where I explicitly called out those misprints int he feature script, I chose not to call them out here. FIM misprints replicate the experience of imperfections giving the objec tmore value. But I wanted the Map misprints to feel more organix






The red tape has been processed, and I'm super excited to announce my next Art Blocks project, Maps of Nothing, which will be unpaused on Monday 6/13 @ 12pm ET

Here is mint #0


The edition size will be 625, and they will be priced at 0.08 ETH each. Why 625? Over the course of development I've looked through about 25k maps, occasionally rendering 1k at a time. With my short attention span, I usually got bored after looking at something between 500 - 750.

Overall, there's a pretty high level of variation here, so 625 feels like the right size. It's also a nice square number.



Why 0.08? My senior market analyst has determined that, given the current macroeconomic climate, the USD<>ETH exchange rate, the weather forecast for next Monday, and the two months and change I spent working on it, 0.08 is a fair price.

CG: Steve, thank you once again for joining my to talk about your newest project, Maps of Nothing.

SP: Of course, thank you once again for having me.

CG: Let's get right into it. This is an amazingly versatile and visually stunning project. I was completely transfixed scrolling through the test collection you sent me. And while it definitely has a certain steviep flair that I can't quite put my finger on, I'll be honest -- This wasn't quite what I was expecting your next big project to be. So I just have to ask: why maps?

SP: You know, I want to keep everyone on their toes.

CG: Haha, clearly!

SP: Honestly, the reason is quite simple. When I started seriously exploring generative art, specifically the so-called "long-form" genre that Art Blocks specializes in, I asked myself what projects I could work on that were both conceptually rich and visually striking. And I came up with two answers: money and maps. The money was higher priority, so that came first. But once Fake Internet Money was wrapped up I started thinking about what a generative map project could look like.

CG: What do you find so visually appealing about maps?

SP: I'm not sure. I think it's just one of those things where, from a purely visual standpoint, it's an incredibly detailed pattern that doesn't always have an obvious order to it. If you cut a splotch out from a map and used some machine learning model to predict and redraw the missing segment, you probably couldn't do it in a lot of cases. But at the same time, maps aren't total chaos. There's still a logic and a flow to them, and I think your brain picks up on that even if it can't quite predict it. And I think that tension is really interesting.

And of course, the reason for all of this is that maps are an abstract representation of something else. If we're talking about street maps, for example, then the grid is really a function of geography and social happenstance. So looking at a map of Brooklyn, for example, there are plenty of places where the stree grid makes total sense... but then it randomly morphes into a completely different grid. Why is that? Well, sometimes it's an artifact of two towns that grew into each other 200 years ago. Sometimes the topography shifts and a different logic makes sense. And those are things that you're not really going to pick up on from just looking at visual patterns.

CG: As the french philosophers like to say, the map is not the territory.

SP: Exactly. And I think that starts to get into why this is such a conceptually rich territory. Maps, along with money, are both these amazing tools of abstraction. But it's interesting how they work in opposite directions. On one hand, money is sort of a reification -- there's a $2 word I learned recently -- of the idea of "value". We take this very abstract idea, and we create a concrete stand in for it. On the other hand, maps are a totally abstracted representation of a physical space.

CG: Right, and I think what's really funny about your last two Art Blocks projects is that you've created the abstraction (or reification) without their counterparts.

SP: You took the words right out of my mouth. So that's why I think the names *Fake* Internet Money, and Maps of *Nothing* are so important to the concepts behind the projects.

CG: They're both such good names, and they really made things click for me. The legalese descriptions are also great. It really elevated FIM, espescially. It feels like a little less obvious of a choice with the maps though.

SP: Yeah, that's a fair point. It wasn't obvious to me either, to be honest. But I chose to do it for a couple reasons. First, it draws a clearer through line between these two projects, which I think helps tease out some of those themes we were just talking about. Second, I think it's a really good way to highlight certain elements of the project without highlighting them. So for example, instead of saying "hey everyone, did you notice how the splotches sort of look like topography sometimes?", you can to say "whatever you do, don't interpret the splotches as topography". And this immediately puts the idea in the head of the viewer without telling them that it *should* look a certain way. It lets them come to their own conclusion, even if you're guiding them. Third, I think this also creates an interesting context in which to view the project. Like, by saying the maps have "no guarantee of accuracy or completeness, and are provided without any warranty whatsoever, either express or implied.", it sort of creates the impression that someone could actually mistake these for real maps, and purchase them with that intention.

CG: It makes me wonder, who the hell are these people buying these maps expecting it to accurately depict reality?

SP: Hey, my lawyers are really strict about these things and I'm just trying to cover all of my bases.

CG: That's true. You don't want a bunch of apes thinking that they have claim to some steviep-created metaverse land.

SP: Seriously though, at the end of the day I also think it's important to remind people that this is an artwork that they're buying, and that they shouldn't necessarily expect utility or a monetary profit from them.

CG: I'd like to dive into some of the ways that you're visually exploring these themes.


SP: Sure. I think it sort of boils down to the idea that these are simulations of paper maps -- each piece is faking the abstraction as well as the material that the abstraction is presented on. So all of the interesting visuals come out of the interplay between what reads as part of the "platonic" map being represented, and what reads as an artifact of the printing process representing that map. The spoltches are probably the best example, where it's never entirely obvious what they're supposed to be. Sometimes they look like they're aspects of the geopgraphy that a city grid is built on top of. Sometimes they look like they're supposed to be crime heat maps. Sometimes they just look like someone spilled coffee on the map. Some of my favorite outputs are the ones where the splotches either fade out or extend beyond the border of the drawn map. It can create a weird effect where they start out feeling like they're part of the "platonic" map, and end up as part of the printed map. The shadows are another example. Sometimes they look like they're cast by mountains, and other times they look like they're cast by paper crumples.

CG: And adding to that, another through line between this project and Fake Internet Money is the inclusion of obvious misprints. And again, this is very funny because you have these very analogue errors injected into this thing that's supposed to be digitally rendered. Like, there's no reason for a map to be drasticlaly printed off center, or to be printed with low ink. It adds an appreciated level of absurdity to it. And this, combined with the project description really makes me wonder about the origin story of some of these maps. Like, what was the context in which this map was printed in such a fucked up way? Who's out there preparing a law suit against you because one of your maps failed to help them navigate their way to a dentist appointment?

SP: We'll leave that as an exercise to the viewer.

CG: Steve, thank you for joining me once again. It's always a pleasure, and I look forward to our next conversation.

SP: The pleasure is all mine.










the simulated imperfections and misprints throughout the collection.







legalese obviously fits in perfectly with the money, but it was a less obvious fit with the maps. And I chose it for two re
















As Baudrillard highlighted on the first page of Simulacra and Simulation, maps are a very good metaphor for how our society is becoming increasingly based on abstractions. He started by quoting the Borges short story where the Cartographers Guild of an empire decide to make map so detailed that it is as large and detailed as the empire itself. And this is, of course, absurd because a map with no abstraction over reality is totally useless. But it makes for an interesting metaphor because at that scale it really blurs the distinction between map and territory. So Baudrillard uses that as a starting point to explore how we've moved to a point where this distinction is even more blurred: Where the Borges story describes a scenario in which the territory precedes the map, we've sort of built a world where the map often precedes the territory.

CG: Right, and one obvious example that comes to mind for me is parts of the DeFi ecosystem. Typically you try to build financial systems that map to some sort of existing economic value. But it some of the more Ponzi-driven corners of the DeFi system you have people building things that claim to create economic value out of thin air, and then reality adapts to that made-up system.

SP: Even in the traditional finance world you have plenty of examples of how the model is either confused with reality, or it dictates reality all together. Pretty much every major financial meltdown over the last 50 years has occurred because financial institutions come up with a really specific model of reality, build complex financial positions based on that model, and then blow up when actual reality deviates from their model.

CG: It seems like, in a lot of ways, Maps of Nothing is about blurring the lines between map and territory.

SP: You could say that. I think one sort of funny aspect of this pr





REALLY, THE POINT:
  - about the interplay between what reads as part of the paper map and what reads as part of the platonic map
  - whereas FIM is all about calling out the misprings, Maps is about obscuring what is a misprint and what isn't a misprint. i think in that sense, it's a project that can only exist as a generative project, and furthermore one that can only exist on something like art blocks.



What I find really interesting about this project is that each piece tells a different origin story. on one hand, there's the origin story of the platonic thing that the map is representing (or, not representing). there's also the origin story of the representation itself.


SIMULATED PRINTING ERRORS

SP:



CG: How do you see this project fitting into your larger body of work? Because on one hand it's a definite departure from the typical content and aesthetics you tend to focus on. But on the other hand, I'm seeing a lot of thematic overlap.

SP: Yeah, I think that's fair. One thing that occurred to me very early on in this project was that my last big project generative was Fake Internet Money, and here I'm essentially generating fake internet maps. So, given that maps themselves are already an abstraction over reality,



In fact, someone recently pointed out to me that FIM had a lot similarities to Magritte's The Treachery of Images. And one of the early working titles of this project was The Treachery of Maps.



CG: We've talked a lot about what was going through your mind with this project. I was hoping we could also talk a bit a bout how you explored these themes visully.

SP: Sure. I think the most obvious way is that I chosed to give the maps a very papery texture, which adds an interesting dimension. Without that texture you're looking at a simulation of a digital map



I think the most obvious way was to give the maps a very papery feel. The background is very textured and has subtle and not-so-subtle shadows, the ink runs when lines are drawn, colors bleed outside the lines, and generally there are subtle imperfections all over. And what makes all of this kind of funny, in my opinion, is that



So really, I think this project is the blurring of the map and territory.

But Baudrillard notes that we've moved beyond

I, of course, have not read much Baudrillard because he's a bad and very dense writer, but I've watched a lot of youtube videos about him and read his wikipedia page!



But there obviously is a logic to it because it's an abstract representation of

CG: other map projects you like?
CG: where does this fit into your body of work?








The biggest thing on my mind as I look over the test collection for this project is how different it appears from your other work. And yet, when I look at it I see a distinct steviep flavor that I can't quite put my finger on. I think what's most impressive about this project is how it shows your versatility as an artist, but I was hoping you could talk a bit about how this project fits into your larger body of work.

Maps are a projection of reality onto a more abstract surface. By their nature, they are meant to be abstractions of reality.
They are simplified versions of reality, but meant to provide a level of guidance and predictability.
If I read the map, then I should be able to traverse the territory that the map represents.
Maps use different strategies fo representation.
But the Map is more than just a reflection of the territory. the Map is also a thing in itself.
and the map has an effect on reality, the territory.
In postmodern thought, maps are often used as a stand in for other forms of abstract representation
Maps of Nothing builds off of this dynamic, where even though it proports to be a mpa, it makes it clear that the map itself does not reflect a territory.
however, the interesting dynamic is that this takes things one level deeper -- it is a simulation of a paper map.
specifically, it is a simulation of a paper map that itself does not proport to represent anything
similar to FIM, this is explored through imperfection. the bumps on the paper are visible, the ink bleeds, the printing escapes the borders, the map is printed askew.
in a bit of a twist, the territory being represented here is itself a map of nothing. and the art being purchased is a map of this territory, which is a map of nothing
and yet, in looking at a map it's almsot impossible to not let your mind project meaning onto it.


in a similar way that FIM was about the deconstruction of money, this is about the deconstruction of maps.
often we're given maps, and we assume that they're a reflection of reality
this applies to not only literal maps, but all abstract representations of things
it's too easy to reify the abstraction
here, the misprints and splotches all serve to break the illusion that the map is an accurate reflection of reality.
not only is it not accurately reflecting reality, but it's not even trying to reflect reality
a street that goes off in a weird direction doesn't mean that a real street goes off in that direction. it doesn't even mean that that street exists


















In 1993, an obscure publication company, Simulacra Publications

published and distributed the following documents.

Their business strategy appears to have been to distribute low quality, computer generated maps to various cities across the continental United States and Europe.

They appear to have been taken off the market immediately because they were fraudulent.

Very little information has survived





Shares a lot of themes and motifs with FIM: particularly around fakeness, representation, digital<>paper relationship, and misprints

These maps are all out of print

No known information survives about the publisher



As the map frays




A map is defined as a representation, usually on a flat surface, of a whole or part of an area.
The job of a map is to describe spatial relationships of specific features that the map aims to represent.
There are many different types of maps that attempt to represent specific things.
Maps can display political boundaries, population, physical features, natural resources, roads, climates, elevation (topography), and economic activities.




And while there have definitely been plenty of other amaxing map-based generative art projects, this one strikes a slightly different tone.

It focuses on the artificiality of map and its fallibility.
To put things in Baudrillardian terms: it highlights the fact that the map is a representation of the territory, and not the territory itself.
And as the map frays, it's unclear whether it represents the decay of the map or of the territory itself.




Where did these maps come from, and what do they represent?
Are they variations of never-built, centrally planned South American Cities?

Are they hand drawn? Printed from a digital artifact?


And what do the markings mean? Are the geographical features, perhaps a reference to physical terrirory on top of which the city was built?
Do they represent some sort of meteorological phenomena? Or maybe they represent some sort of social or ideological __, projected into physical space?
Or maybe they don't represent anything at all. Maybe they they're just the result of the decay of the map itself.


"Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance. It is generated by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory--procession of simulacrs--that engenders the territory, snf if one must return to the fable, today it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the extent of the map. It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empirs, but ours. The desert fo the real."






i guess the idea is that it's unclear where the map starts and the territory ends.
the map is a territory in itself. and when it comes to street layouts, the territory is actually a form of map.



do the blotches represent a mapping of the territory, or the territory of the map?
is it a representation of the thing th emap is of? or is it a decay of the actual map itself?



maps are representations of reality. highlight the fact that this is a representation.
In the Borges story, the maps become so larger that they effectively contain no abstraction.


each map seems to tell a story, but they're stories of things that have never existed.

all of the zones/clouds/splotches can represent numerous things.
they can represent a social abstraction - an ideology, a community, a district
they can represent a natural system parallel to the city grid - topology, weather
or, they can represent the degredation of the map itself


one thing that this makes me think of is how there are all of these immaterial zones and structures
that we try to map onto physical space and represent with abstractions. it could be walking into a neighborhood
and crossing through the in-between area of that neighborhood. what do the blotches represent in the context of the map?
or, do they represent nothing? are they a random coffee stain



i guess the idea is that maps are a representation of reality, and that representation can be constructed in multiple different ways




In 1986, a team of estonian neuroscientists conducted an experiment in which participants
were given a description of a non existent terain. Participants were then measured by an fMRI
and were asked to describe, in as much detail as possible, the most likely infrastructural network
to arise from this terrain.

There are many other details missing from this experiment, chief of which is the initial hypothesis
of the experiment


In all, 961 trials have been confirmed, although many speculate that the methodology of the tests may have
been inconsistent from trial to trial. Additionally, it's clear that the storage procedures differ drastically
from output to output, with some having degraded substantially.

  - should have more that have no black bg color schemes
  - fewer with choppy clouds
    - maybe when it does pop up, either have really low threshold or higher threshold
    - or, at very least have a higher noise divisor
    - 92, 112 are good ones
  - rare bg: each stroke is a random hue


2-12 notes
  - do a deep dive on 2-layer outputs. modify rules to make those look better
  - do a deep dive on zoomed out pieces. make high contrast bg strokes look better
  - adjust high density zoomed out outputs
  - animation intro?
  - name?




  2 layers
    - no paper/faded/burnt
    - no gradient



2-11 notes
  - should make the primary/secondary aves thinner, espescially for hig density
  - with turbulence, streets look too dotty
  - maybe don't have high graininess on neon
  - play with noise harmonics



2-13 notes
  - more 20deg color changes
  - should have an initial hue change, and the subsequent hue change
  - should also play around with changing darkness, saturation
  - higher noise divisor min with dark bgs
  - more straight streets

2-14 notes
  - nix the symmetry
  - elevation gradient might need ot be more subtle, espescially on paper
    - maybe try saturation/brightness modifications again


2-16 notes
  - high density zoomed out looks weird
  - maybe increase kinked streets



2-19 notes
  - paper gradient looks pretty bad



2-20 notes
  - zoomed out streets are too thin. maybe make them either less common or increase probability of turbulence
  - instead of 180, 120, etc hue shift, do warm/cold color palettes


2-23 notes
  - force topological pattern to be always subtle colors
  - dotted lines with dotLine (0% - 50%)
  - keep tweaking borderType 0

2-24
  - should main burnt hue apply to street colors as well as bg?



2-27
  - lower gradient/faded prob a bit? maybe lower gradient from 75
  - increase border bleed prob



2-29
  - think about color directions. it starts somewhere and moves through color space.
  - hide stars in some of them
  - white/black should have a subtle saturation tint


  - more high border drift w/o borders
  - b/w + w/b gradients based on brightness
  - reduce street turbulence by a tad (2-29/402)
  - hue diff -> choose randomly from a hue range
  - maybe make misprints more common, but also generally more subtle

  - need to find a way to have more zoomed out 1-layers
  - many layers, zoomed out with hard curves doesn't look great

  - need to rethink layer distribution
    - right now 2, 3, 4 make up 80%. that feels like a lot
  - too many 4-layers
  - too many 12 layers

  - maybe too much white bg?

2-30
  - lower 12layer, unless high noise divisor
  - for close up turbulence, increase threshold diff or have fewer layers. the dots in the line really come through when street colors change
    - actually, all close ups don't look great
    - only increase threhshold diff if street is visible and changing colors dramatically
    - 350 is sort of on the cusp of looking bad at 0.987
  - maybe always lighten neon (or, lighten neon when paired with b/w)
  - force gradient rate is too high
  - for single layers, much lower rate of gradient, or remove base gradient all together
  - 2 level color on black doesn't really seem to work. does any 2 level black work?
    - really, neon/burnt, unless it's the same color
  - in general, bring gradient level down for top and bottom. rainbows are good once in a while, but they're too frequent
  - graininess doesn't look great when its the only color in a b/w
  - need to evaluate high contrast
  - need to evaluate anything goes default rule shifts
  - look at 15-50 LAYER_N


2-31
  - maybe take the green saturation down a little bit (60) and magenta (86)
  - no streets (160, 403)
  - maybe a slightly more maxGradient
  - consider higher variability in border thickness. default can probably run a little thicker
  - 1 layer + no bleed -> more likely to have thinner padding
  - border should be thicher for more zoomed in maps
  - misprint is completely broken with padding refactor
  - rarity: no streets, a lot of layers, border


2-32
  - lower prob for 7 - 30. maybe even eliminate 30
  - maybe keep probability for fatter pads
  - maybe make lower density more likely -- or, at least something between avg and low density
    - (but not for fat padding + zoomed in)

  - maybe keep color path for rule 4, but otherwise pick a hue palatte at beginning, shuffle it, and cycle through it


2-33
  - make turbulence a spectrum. maybe street turbulence as well
  - make more 1-layers, paper or w/b.
  - should maybe make paper more w/b-like
  - density should be more of a spectrum
  - more low density, more 1-layer w/b; the empty look is pretty nice
  - need more instances of kinked only dark, street turb
  - make street turbulence width noise based
  - other street types should have turbulence
  - street turbulence -> air brush
  - airbrush prob for each street
  - street caps shouldn't be true circles. either draw with vertex or draw a bunch with some turbulence
  - add inverted color scheme
  - color rule where bright/faded = adjColor(h, 65, 65)/adjColor(h, 55, 65)
    - maybe apply more frequently to middle layers
    - maybe dont' apply to dark color rule
    - need to tweak on only color color rule
    - maybe middle layer is one lighting rule, and top/bottom  is the other lighting rule
      - maybe this is with higher N
      - all of them same lighting level looks better on lower N
      - maybe keep middle and top/bottom layers same level of luminance
  - need to thicken ones that are zoomed out less
  - maybe don't randomly choose hue -- probabilistically choose hue based on LAYER_N and rule

2-34
  - maybe nix the diaganal streets

2-35
  - darken the colors ("darker lighting") when dark bg
  - maybe change base rule back to:
        [5, 'whiteAndBlack'],
        [5, 'blackAndWhite'],
        [SCALE <= 0.3 ? 0 : 5, 'neon'],




























Visual theme idea: 2 dimensional map platered on top of a three dimensional topography. think of rolling hills with a two dimensional map drawn on top of it

Theory
  https://jacket2.org/commentary/introduction-maps



AVENUE
  - thicker lines
  - spawn streets at ~90deg
  - occasionally spawn other avenues

STREET
  - occasionally skip
  - occasionally jump over
  - stop at avenues with higher precidence

HIGHWAY
  - sort of like avenues, exept overlaps, no precidence, no spawns (except maybe exits)

POLYGON
  - river
    - stop or bridge



Styles
  - out of focus/seeing doubles
  - very wavy
  - multiple layers with blended starting/stopping

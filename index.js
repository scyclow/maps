Maps are a projection of reality onto a more abstract surface. By their nature, they are meant to be abstractions of reality.
They are simplified versions of reality, but meant to provide a level of guidance and predictability.
If I read the map, then I should be able to traverse the territory that the map represents.
Maps use different strategies fo representation.
But the Map is more than just a reflection of the territory. the Map is also a thing in itself.
and the map has an effect on reality, the territory.
In postmodern thought, maps are often used as a stand in for other forms of abstract representation
Maps of Nothing builds off of this dynamic, where even though it proports to be a mpa, it makes it clear that the map itself does not reflect a territory.
however, the interesting dynamic is that this takes things one level deeper -- it is a simulation of a paper map.
specifically, it is a simulation of a paper map that itself does not proport to represent anything
similar to FIM, this is explored through imperfection. the bumps on the paper are visible, the ink bleeds, the printing escapes the borders, the map is printed askew.
in a bit of a twist, the territory being represented here is itself a map of nothing. and the art being purchased is a map of this territory, which is a map of nothing
and yet, in looking at a map it's almsot impossible to not let your mind project meaning onto it.


in a similar way that FIM was about the deconstruction of money, this is about the deconstruction of maps.
often we're given maps, and we assume that they're a reflection of reality
this applies to not only literal maps, but all abstract representations of things
it's too easy to reify the abstraction
here, the misprints and splotches all serve to break the illusion that the map is an accurate reflection of reality.
not only is it not accurately reflecting reality, but it's not even trying to reflect reality
a street that goes off in a weird direction doesn't mean that a real street goes off in that direction. it doesn't even mean that that street exists


















In 1993, an obscure publication company, Simulacra Publications

published and distributed the following documents.

Their business strategy appears to have been to distribute low quality, computer generated maps to various cities across the continental United States and Europe.

They appear to have been taken off the market immediately because they were fraudulent.

Very little information has survived

As the map frays




A map is defined as a representation, usually on a flat surface, of a whole or part of an area.
The job of a map is to describe spatial relationships of specific features that the map aims to represent.
There are many different types of maps that attempt to represent specific things.
Maps can display political boundaries, population, physical features, natural resources, roads, climates, elevation (topography), and economic activities.




And while there have definitely been plenty of other amaxing map-based generative art projects, this one strikes a slightly different tone.

It focuses on the artificiality of map and its fallibility.
To put things in Baudrillardian terms: it highlights the fact that the map is a representation of the territory, and not the territory itself.
And as the map frays, it's unclear whether it represents the decay of the map or of the territory itself.




Where did these maps come from, and what do they represent?
Are they variations of never-built, centrally planned South American Cities?

Are they hand drawn? Printed from a digital artifact?


And what do the markings mean? Are the geographical features, perhaps a reference to physical terrirory on top of which the city was built?
Do they represent some sort of meteorological phenomena? Or maybe they represent some sort of social or ideological __, projected into physical space?
Or maybe they don't represent anything at all. Maybe they they're just the result of the decay of the map itself.


"Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance. It is generated by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory--procession of simulacrs--that engenders the territory, snf if one must return to the fable, today it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the extent of the map. It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empirs, but ours. The desert fo the real."






i guess the idea is that it's unclear where the map starts and the territory ends.
the map is a territory in itself. and when it comes to street layouts, the territory is actually a form of map.



do the blotches represent a mapping of the territory, or the territory of the map?
is it a representation of the thing th emap is of? or is it a decay of the actual map itself?



maps are representations of reality. highlight the fact that this is a representation.
In the Borges story, the maps become so larger that they effectively contain no abstraction.


each map seems to tell a story, but they're stories of things that have never existed.

all of the zones/clouds/splotches can represent numerous things.
they can represent a social abstraction - an ideology, a community, a district
they can represent a natural system parallel to the city grid - topology, weather
or, they can represent the degredation of the map itself


one thing that this makes me think of is how there are all of these immaterial zones and structures
that we try to map onto physical space and represent with abstractions. it could be walking into a neighborhood
and crossing through the in-between area of that neighborhood. what do the blotches represent in the context of the map?
or, do they represent nothing? are they a random coffee stain



i guess the idea is that maps are a representation of reality, and that representation can be constructed in multiple different ways




In 1986, a team of estonian neuroscientists conducted an experiment in which participants
were given a description of a non existent terain. Participants were then measured by an fMRI
and were asked to describe, in as much detail as possible, the most likely infrastructural network
to arise from this terrain.

There are many other details missing from this experiment, chief of which is the initial hypothesis
of the experiment


In all, 961 trials have been confirmed, although many speculate that the methodology of the tests may have
been inconsistent from trial to trial. Additionally, it's clear that the storage procedures differ drastically
from output to output, with some having degraded substantially.

/*
2-2 notes

  - higher minimum noise divisor (or, make layer1 threshold higher when low noise divisor)
  - layer 2 neon on neon/dark doesn't look great when only two layers


2-3 notes
  - for hard curves, and zoomed out, noise divisor should be a lot higher
  - for zoomed in, main avenue should start within the frame, be straighter



2-6 notes
  - it seems like the avg elevation thing isn't quite working any more? ex 142, 125 (it works sometimes, but not sure i like it on the whole)
  - for papers, should make street colors in reverse order of luminesence
  - base bright should also have a version where streets have some color
  - maybe dark/neon should have base color streets as well


2-8 notes
  - should have more that have no black bg color schemes
  - fewer with choppy clouds
    - maybe when it does pop up, either have really low threshold or higher threshold
    - or, at very least have a higher noise divisor
    - 92, 112 are good ones
  - rare bg: each stroke is a random hue


2-12 notes
  - do a deep dive on 2-layer outputs. modify rules to make those look better
  - do a deep dive on zoomed out pieces. make high contrast bg strokes look better
  - adjust high density zoomed out outputs
  - animation intro?
  - name?




  2 layers
    - no paper/faded/burnt
    - no gradient



2-11 notes
  - should make the primary/secondary aves thinner, espescially for hig density
  - with turbulence, streets look too dotty
  - maybe don't have high graininess on neon
  - play with noise harmonics



2-13 notes
  - more 20deg color changes
  - should have an initial hue change, and the subsequent hue change
  - should also play around with changing darkness, saturation
  - higher noise divisor min with dark bgs
  - more straight streets

2-14 notes
  - nix the symmetry
  - elevation gradient might need ot be more subtle, espescially on paper
    - maybe try saturation/brightness modifications again


2-16 notes
  - high density zoomed out looks weird
  - maybe increase kinked streets



2-19 notes
  - paper gradient looks pretty bad



2-20 notes
  - zoomed out streets are too thin. maybe make them either less common or increase probability of turbulence
  - instead of 180, 120, etc hue shift, do warm/cold color palettes


2-23 notes
  - force topological pattern to be always subtle colors
  - dotted lines with dotLine (0% - 50%)
  - keep tweaking borderType 0

2-24
  - should main burnt hue apply to street colors as well as bg?



2-27
  - lower gradient/faded prob a bit? maybe lower gradient from 75
  - increase border bleed prob



2-29
  - think about color directions. it starts somewhere and moves through color space.
  - hide stars in some of them
  - white/black should have a subtle saturation tint


  - more high border drift w/o borders
  - b/w + w/b gradients based on brightness
  - reduce street turbulence by a tad (2-29/402)
  - hue diff -> choose randomly from a hue range
  - maybe make misprints more common, but also generally more subtle

  - need to find a way to have more zoomed out 1-layers
  - many layers, zoomed out with hard curves doesn't look great

  - need to rethink layer distribution
    - right now 2, 3, 4 make up 80%. that feels like a lot
  - too many 4-layers
  - too many 12 layers

  - maybe too much white bg?

2-30
  - lower 12layer, unless high noise divisor
  - for close up turbulence, increase threshold diff or have fewer layers. the dots in the line really come through when street colors change
    - actually, all close ups don't look great
    - only increase threhshold diff if street is visible and changing colors dramatically
    - 350 is sort of on the cusp of looking bad at 0.987
  - maybe always lighten neon (or, lighten neon when paired with b/w)
  - force gradient rate is too high
  - for single layers, much lower rate of gradient, or remove base gradient all together
  - 2 level color on black doesn't really seem to work. does any 2 level black work?
    - really, neon/burnt, unless it's the same color
  - in general, bring gradient level down for top and bottom. rainbows are good once in a while, but they're too frequent
  - graininess doesn't look great when its the only color in a b/w
  - need to evaluate high contrast
  - need to evaluate anything goes default rule shifts
  - look at 15-50 LAYER_N


2-31
  - maybe take the green saturation down a little bit (60) and magenta (86)
  - no streets (160, 403)
  - maybe a slightly more maxGradient
  - consider higher variability in border thickness. default can probably run a little thicker
  - 1 layer + no bleed -> more likely to have thinner padding
  - border should be thicher for more zoomed in maps
  - misprint is completely broken with padding refactor
  - rarity: no streets, a lot of layers, border


2-32
  - lower prob for 7 - 30. maybe even eliminate 30
  - maybe keep probability for fatter pads
  - maybe make lower density more likely -- or, at least something between avg and low density
    - (but not for fat padding + zoomed in)

  - maybe keep color path for rule 4, but otherwise pick a hue palatte at beginning, shuffle it, and cycle through it


2-33
  - make turbulence a spectrum. maybe street turbulence as well
  - make more 1-layers, paper or w/b.
  - should maybe make paper more w/b-like
  - density should be more of a spectrum
  - more low density, more 1-layer w/b; the empty look is pretty nice
  - need more instances of kinked only dark, street turb
  - make street turbulence width noise based
  - other street types should have turbulence
  - street turbulence -> air brush
  - airbrush prob for each street
  - street caps shouldn't be true circles. either draw with vertex or draw a bunch with some turbulence
  - add inverted color scheme
  - color rule where bright/faded = adjColor(h, 65, 65)/adjColor(h, 55, 65)
    - maybe apply more frequently to middle layers
    - maybe dont' apply to dark color rule
    - need to tweak on only color color rule
    - maybe middle layer is one lighting rule, and top/bottom  is the other lighting rule
      - maybe this is with higher N
      - all of them same lighting level looks better on lower N
      - maybe keep middle and top/bottom layers same level of luminance
  - need to thicken ones that are zoomed out less
  - maybe don't randomly choose hue -- probabilistically choose hue based on LAYER_N and rule

2-34
  - maybe nix the diaganal streets

2-35
  - darken the colors ("darker lighting") when dark bg
  - maybe change base rule back to:
        [5, 'whiteAndBlack'],
        [5, 'blackAndWhite'],
        [SCALE <= 0.3 ? 0 : 5, 'neon'],
